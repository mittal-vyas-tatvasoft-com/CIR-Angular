Per file, the code must not exceed from 400 lines limit
Per function, the code must not exceed from 75 lines
Maintain Constant For All Constants
Always use ng commands to use component, module, service etc.
Break large components into small reusable components
Use NgIf and not CSS - If DOM elements aren’t visible, instead of hiding them with CSS, it's a good practice to remove them from the DOM by using *ngIf.
Do limit logic in a component to only that required for the view. All other logic should be delegated to services.
Do move reusable logic to services and keep components simple and focused on their intended purpose.
Using strict types instead of "any"
It is a good practice to document each variable and method. For methods, we need to define it using multi-line comments on what task the method performs and all parameters should be explained.
Do place private members before public members
Do create services with a single responsibility that is encapsulated by its context.
If the values of the variables are intact, declare it with const
Names of properties and methods should be in lower camel case
Do use upper camel case for class names.
Use PascalCase for enum values.
We shouldn’t name our interfaces with the starting capital I letter as we do in some programming languages.
